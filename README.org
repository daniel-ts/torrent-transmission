#+TITLE: transmission+vpn inside own network namespace

Run a transmission-daemon via systemd in its own network namespace where a
WireGuard VPN interace is the only way to reach the outside world to ensure /a
certain type of anonymity/ ;)

This is just my setup with all the parameters hard coded inside the systemd
service files.

* Dependencies
- =dnsmasq=
- =systemd=
- =transmission-daemon=

* Setup
- Clone the repo
- Adjust the parameters like IP veth pair IP addresses inside the service files
- Put the WireGuard VPN config files into =/etc/wireguard=
- Install =transmission-daemon= and =dnsmasq=
- Configure =transmission-daemon= inside =/etc/transmission/daemon=
