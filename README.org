#+TITLE: transmission+vpn inside own network namespace

Run a transmission-daemon via systemd in its own network namespace where a
WireGuard VPN interace is the only way to reach the outside world to ensure /a
certain type of anonymity/ ;)

This is just my setup with all the parameters hard coded inside the systemd
service files.

* Dependencies
- =dnsmasq=
- =iproute2= (=ip= utility)
- =systemd=
- =transmission-daemon=

* Setup
- Clone the repo
- Adjust the parameters like IP veth pair IP addresses inside the service files
- Put the WireGuard VPN config files into =/etc/wireguard=
- Install =transmission-daemon= and =dnsmasq=
- Configure =transmission-daemon= inside =/etc/transmission/daemon=

* Why not put all of that into a container
I think network namespace isolation is enough. =podman= actually drives me nuts
when I need to set up WireGuard inside it.

* TODO
- Better README
- Factor out parameters into a seperate file (somehow)
- Maybe make this into an Ansible playbook
